# Privacy Policy for Zen Task New Tab

**Effective Date:** February 08, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Zen Task New Tab ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected when you use the Zen Task Chrome Extension and how it is used.

**Summary:** We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data on our servers. All data remains on your device or is synced via your own Chrome account.

## 2. Information We Collect
We do not collect any personal information (PII) or usage data on our own servers.

### 2.1 User Input Data
*   **Tasks**: The task names and statuses you enter are stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local` or synced across your signed-in Chrome browsers using `chrome.storage.sync`.
*   **Settings**: Your preferences (e.g., timer duration, sound settings) are stored similarly.

### 2.2 Permissions
*   **`storage`**: Used solely to save your tasks and settings so they persist between sessions.
*   **`alarms`**: Used to run the focus timer in the background.
*   **`notifications`**: Used to show you a system notification when your timer completes.

## 3. How We Use Information
All information (tasks and settings) is used exclusively for the functionality of the extension:
*   To display your to-do list.
*   To run your focus timers.
*   To sync your state between your own devices (if Chrome Sync is enabled).

We **do not** have access to this data. It is not transmitted to any third-party analytics services or advertising networks.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party tracking, analytics, or advertising services.

## 5. Data Security
Your data is stored within the secure sandbox of the Chrome browser. If you use Chrome Sync, your data is encrypted and handled according to Google's privacy policies.

## 6. Children's Privacy
We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date".
